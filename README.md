# Echo-skill-Arduino-IR-sender
alexa skill to have arduino yun send ir signal to a device

#checklist will expand further when complete
* record ir raw signals from remote
* placed ir signal codes on arduino yun
* connect yun to nearbus so rest commands can be sent to the yun and not port forwarding is needed
* make skill for alexa to send the rest command to the yun.

Then end game is to have my cheap roomba knockoff be controlled by alexa.
this could be expanded to other ir device.
